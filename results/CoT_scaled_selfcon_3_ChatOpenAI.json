Since each classroom has an unknown number of students, let's call the total number of students in the school \"S\". If we divide S by the average number of students per classroom, we should get the total number of classrooms. So S / (unknown average) = 84. Solving for the average, we get S / 84 = (11110 seats) / (unknown average). Cross-multiplying, we get S x (unknown average) = 84 x 11110. Dividing both sides by (unknown average), we get S = (84 x 11110) / (unknown average). Since we don't know the average number of students per classroom, we can't solve for S exactly. However, we can see that the total number of students in the school will be larger than 84 x 118 (the number of seats on all the buses) since there are 84 classrooms and each classroom likely has more than one student.

Since they can't plant a fractional flower bed, we round down to 3 flower beds. Each flower bed grew 60 flowers, so they grew a total of 3 x 60 = 180 flowers. The answer is 180."
