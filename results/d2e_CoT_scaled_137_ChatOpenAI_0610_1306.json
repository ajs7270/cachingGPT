The total number of pages she had to complete is the sum of the pages of math and reading homework: x + (x + 411) = 2x + 411. We know that this total is equal to 1096, so we can write the equation 2x + 411 = 1096. Solving for x, we get x = 342. Therefore, Rachel had to complete 342 + 411 = 753 pages of math homework and 342 pages of reading homework, for a total of 1095 pages. The answer is 1095."

So the total amount of wax he needs is 7,809 g + 3,014 g = 10,823 g. Since the question asks how much wax he already has, we don't need to do any subtraction. The answer is not given in the question."

To find out how many flower beds they had, we need to divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds that grew into flowers in each flower bed: 4,932 \u00f7 7,946 = 0.62. Since they can't have a fraction of a flower bed, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they had 0 flower beds.
