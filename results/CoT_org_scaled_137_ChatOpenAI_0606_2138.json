Let's divide the total number of visitors by the number of days to get the average number of visitors per day: 102065 / 7809 = 13.07. So on average, 13.07 visitors came to the Buckingham palace each day. To find the total number of visitors in 7809 days, we multiply the average number of visitors per day by the number of days: 13.07 x 7809 = 101925.63. Since we can't have a fraction of a visitor, we round down to the nearest whole number. The answer is 101925."

We know that this is equal to 1918, so we can write:\n\n2J + 548 = 1918\n\nSubtracting 548 from both sides gives:\n\n2J = 1370\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\nJ = 685\n\nSo Jackie has 685 apples, and Adam has 685 + 548 = 1233 apples. Together they have 1918 apples. Now we can find out how many apples Bob has. We know that Bob has 822 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so we can write:\n\nBob = 1918 + 822\n\nAdding these gives:\n\nBob = 2740\n\nSo Bob has 2740 apples. The answer is 2740."

If they planted a total of 7535 seeds, that means they planted 7535/2055 = 3.67 flower beds. Since they can't plant a fraction of a flower bed, they must have planted 3 flower beds. Therefore, they grew 3 flower beds x 4 flowers per bed = 12 flowers. The answer is 12."
