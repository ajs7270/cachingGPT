Let's call Dean's height \"h\":\n\nDepth = 245,745h\n\nNow we need to find Dean's height.

After Doug lost some marbles, he had x - y marbles (where \"y\" is the number of marbles he lost). And we also know that Ed now has x + 311,277 marbles. So we can set up an equation: \n\nx + 311,277 = (x - y) + (32,766 + x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n311,277 = 32,766 + 2x - y\n\nSubtracting 32,766 from both sides, we get:\n\n278,511 = 2x - y\n\nWe don't know the exact values of x and y, but we do know that y is a positive number (since Doug lost marbles). So the maximum value of 2x - y would occur if y = 0 (meaning Doug didn't lose any marbles), and the minimum value would occur if x = 0 (meaning Doug had no marbles to begin with). \n\nIf y = 0, then 2x = 278,511, so x = 139,255.5. But x has to be a whole number (since we're talking about marbles), so this doesn't work. \n\nIf x = 0, then 2x - y = -y, so we need to find a positive value of y such that:\n\n32,766 - y + 311,277 = -y\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n344,043 = 2y\n\nSo y = 172,021.5. But again, y has to be a whole number, so this doesn't work either. \n\nTherefore, there is no whole number solution to this problem.

Let's check our work. \n\nActually, we need to divide the total capacity by the capacity of each seat to find the number of seats: \n\n65,532 / 32,766 = 2 \n\nSo the Ferris wheel has 2 seats. \n\nOops, we made the same mistake again! Let's try one more time. \n\nTo find the number of seats on the Ferris wheel, we need to divide the total capacity by the capacity of each seat: \n\n65,532 / 32,766 = 2 \n\nBut this doesn't make sense, because we know the Ferris wheel has more than 2 seats! \n\nThe problem is that we're dividing the wrong way. We need to divide the total capacity by the number of people each seat can hold: \n\n65,532 / 1 seat = 65,532 \n\nThen we can divide the total capacity by the capacity of each seat to check our answer: \n\n65,532 / 32,766 = 2 \n\nSo the Ferris wheel has 65,532 seats. The answer is 65,532."
