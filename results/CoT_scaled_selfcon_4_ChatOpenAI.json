And Bob has 6 more than that, so he has 2x+4+6 = 2x+10 apples. We also know that together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples, so 2x+4 = 14. Solving for x, we have 2x = 10, so x = 5. That means Jackie has 5 apples, Adam has 9 apples (5+4), and together they have 14 apples. And Bob has 6 more than that, so he has 20 apples (2x+10). The answer is 20."

            "openai": "A: Let's call the number of cups of flour Mary has already put in \"x.\" According to the problem, she needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, which means she needs x + 8 cups of flour and x cups of sugar. We also know that the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar, so we can set up an equation: \n\nx + 8 = 6 \nx = 6 - 8 \nx = -2 \n\nThis doesn't make sense, because Mary can't have negative cups of flour or sugar. So we made a mistake somewhere. Let's try setting up the equation again, but this time using the fact that she needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar: \n\nx + 8 = 6 + (x - 13) \nx + 8 = x - 7 \n15 = x \n\nSo Mary has already put in 15 cups of flour. To find out how many more cups she needs to add, we can subtract this from the total amount of flour needed: \n\n6 - 15 = -9 \n\nAgain, this doesn't make sense. We made another mistake somewhere. Let's try setting up the equation one more time: \n\nx + 8 = 6 + (13 + x) \nx + 8 = 19 + x \n8 = 19 - x \nx = 11 \n\nSo Mary has already put in 11 cups of sugar. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can use the fact that she needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar: \n\nx = 11 + 8 \nx = 19 \n\nSo Mary needs to add 19 cups of flour to the cake.

We know that the grasshopper, frog, and mouse all participated in the jumping contest, so their distances must add up to 39 + F + (F - 12) = 78 + F. We can solve for F by subtracting 78 from both sides of the equation: F = 78 - 39 - (F - 12) = 51 + F - 12. Simplifying this equation, we get F = 39. So the frog jumped 39 inches, the grasshopper jumped 39 + 19 = 58 inches, and the mouse jumped 39 - 12 = 27 inches. The answer is 27."
