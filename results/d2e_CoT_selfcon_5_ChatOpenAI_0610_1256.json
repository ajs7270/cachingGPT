We don't know how many bottle caps he had at first, but we do know that the total number of items he found at the park was 6 + 55 = 61. So if he had x bottle caps at first, we can set up the equation x + 8 + 61 = 28 + 63, since he started with x bottle caps, 8 wrappers, and found 61 items at the park, and ended up with 28 bottle caps and 63 wrappers.

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get: (Doug + 24) + 9 = Doug - 27. Simplifying this gives us: Doug - 18 = Doug - 27 + 24. Simplifying further gives us: Doug - 18 = Doug - 3. Solving for Doug gives us: Doug = 15. This means that Ed had 15 + 24 = 39 marbles originally. After Ed found 9 more, he had 39 + 9 = 48 marbles.
