Since she gave away some Ace cards, she now has 356 - a Ace cards left. And since she has 415 cards left in total, she must have 415 - (356 - a) = 59 + a baseball cards left. We want to find the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards she has left, which is (59 + a) - (356 - a) = 2a - 297. We don't know the value of \"a\", but we do know that the number of Ace cards left is less than or equal to the number of baseball cards left, so we can set up the inequality 356 - a \u2264 415 - (356 - a), which simplifies to 2a \u2264 414. Dividing both sides by 2, we get a \u2264 207. So Nell gave away at most 207 Ace cards. If she gave away exactly 207 Ace cards, then she has 356 - 207 = 149 Ace cards left, and 59 + 207 = 266 baseball cards left. The difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards she has left is 266 - 149 = 117. So if Nell gave away 207 Ace cards, then she has 117 more baseball cards than Ace cards left.

However, the question asks for how many chapters he read per day, not pages. Since we know there are 2 chapters in the book, we can multiply 1.22 by 1/405 (the number of pages in one chapter) and then multiply by 2: 1.22 x 1/405 x 2 = 0.006, or approximately 0.01 chapters per day.

            "openai": "A: Let's call the number of apples Adam has \"A\" and the number of apples Jackie has \"J\". We know that A + J = 12 (because they have 12 apples together). We also know that He (let's call him \"H\") has 9 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so H = A + J + 9. Finally, we know that Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, so A = J + 8. We can use substitution to solve for H: \n\nH = A + J + 9\nH = (J + 8) + J + 9 (substituting A = J + 8)\nH = 2J + 17\n\nWe also know that A + J = 12, so we can solve for J: \n\nA + J = 12\n(J + 8) + J = 12 (substituting A = J + 8)\n2J + 8 = 12\n2J = 4\nJ = 2\n\nSo Jackie has 2 apples. We can use this to solve for Adam: \n\nA = J + 8\nA = 2 + 8\nA = 10\n\nSo Adam has 10 apples. Finally, we can use this to solve for H: \n\nH = 2J + 17\nH = 2(2) + 17\nH = 21\n\nSo He has 21 apples.
