We don't know the average number of visitors per day, so we can't divide directly to find the answer. However, we do know that the number of visitors is directly proportional to the number of days. So if 949 visitors came in 2 days, we can set up a proportion to find out how many visitors would come in 25 days:\n\n949 visitors / 2 days = x visitors / 25 days\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 949 visitors / 2 days * 25 days = 11,862.5 visitors\n\nSince we can't have half a visitor, we round up to the nearest whole number. The answer is 11,863 visitors."

Plugging this into our equation: \n\ny = [114 \u00b1 sqrt(114^2 - 4(1)(196)(7))] / 2 \n\ny \u2248 4.9 or y \u2248 18.1 \n\nSince we're looking for a whole number of bags, the answer is 18 bags of cookies."
