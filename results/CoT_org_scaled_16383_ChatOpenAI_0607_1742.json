We also know that she had to complete a total of 114681 pages of homework, so:\n\nr + (r + 65532) = 114681\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2r + 65532 = 114681\n\nSubtracting 65532 from both sides, we get:\n\n2r = 49149\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nr = 24574.5\n\nSince Rachel can't complete half a page of homework, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

One way to do this is to factor both numbers:\n\n458724 = 2^2 * 3 * 13 * 1861\n229362 = 2 * 3 * 38227\n\nWe can see that both numbers have factors of 2 and 3, so we can divide both by 6 to simplify:\n\n458724 / 6 = 76454\n229362 / 6 = 38227\n\nNow we can see that 38227 is a factor of both numbers, so each bag must have 38227 cookies. To check, we can multiply 38227 by the number of bags:\n\n229362 bags * 38227 cookies per bag = 8765439 cookies\n\nNow we can add the number of candies to find the total number of treats:\n\n8765439 cookies + 1408938 candies = 10114377 treats\n\nSo there are 229362 bags of cookies.

We also know that J = A + 65532 (since Jackie has 65532 more apples than Adam and Jackie together). We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get A + (A + 65532) = 98298. Simplifying this equation, we get 2A + 65532 = 98298. Subtracting 65532 from both sides, we get 2A = 32766. Dividing both sides by 2, we get A = 16383. So Adam has 16383 apples. To find out how many apples Jackie has, we can substitute A = 16383 into the equation J = A + 65532 to get J = 81915. So Jackie has 81915 apples. Finally, we can check that Adam and Jackie together have 98298 apples by adding their individual amounts: 16383 + 81915 = 98298. The answer is 81915."
