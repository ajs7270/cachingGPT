If each book costs 17.4 cents, we can divide 600 by 17.4 to find out how many books Edward had before spending his money. \n\n600 \u00f7 17.4 is approximately 34.48, or 34 books (rounded down). \n\nSo Edward had 34 books before spending his money. To check, we can multiply 34 by 17.4 cents to see if it equals 6 dollars: \n\n34 x 0.174 = 5.916 \n\nThis is close enough to 6 dollars, accounting for rounding errors.

After giving Jeff those Ace cards, she had 376 - x Ace cards left. We want to find how many more Ace cards than baseball cards she has, so we need to subtract the number of baseball cards she has left from the number of Ace cards she has left: 376 - x - 111 = 265 - x.

So Nell gave Jeff 128 + 10 = 138 Ace cards. And now Nell has 376 - 10 = 366 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards. Therefore, she has 366 - 111 = 255 more Ace cards than baseball cards.
