They made $ Two Hundred Thirty Two off each jersey, so they made a total of Forty Three x Two Hundred Thirty Two = $ Nine Thousand Nine Hundred and Seventy Six from jersey sales. To find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, we need to subtract the total revenue from t-shirt sales from the total revenue from jersey sales: Nine Thousand Nine Hundred and Seventy Six - Twenty Two Thousand and Forty Four = $- Twelve Thousand Nine Hundred and Sixty Eight. This means that a jersey costs $ Twelve Thousand Nine Hundred and Sixty Eight dollars more than a t-shirt."

            "openai": "A: We can use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the total number of eggs that Rebecca has. We know that she wants to split them into groups of 11, and each group has 2 eggs. So we can write:\n\nx = 11 * 2n\n\nwhere n is the number of groups. We can simplify this equation:\n\nx = 22n\n\nWe don't know how many groups there are, but we know that the number of eggs must be a multiple of 22. The smallest multiple of 22 that is greater than 0 is 22 itself. So Rebecca must have at least 22 eggs. If she has more than 22 eggs, she can split them into groups of 11 with 2 eggs in each group. For example, if she has 44 eggs, she can make 2 groups of 11 with 2 eggs in each group. The answer is that we don't have enough information to determine how many eggs Rebecca has, but we know that the number must be a multiple of 22."

We can use these equations to solve for A and J: \n\nA = J + 4 \nA + J = 14 \n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation: \n\n(J + 4) + J = 14 \n2J + 4 = 14 \n2J = 10 \nJ = 5 \n\nSo Jackie has 5 apples. We can use the first equation to find that Adam has A = J + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 apples. \n\nFinally, we know that Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so B = A + J + 6 = 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 apples. \n\nThe answer is 20."
