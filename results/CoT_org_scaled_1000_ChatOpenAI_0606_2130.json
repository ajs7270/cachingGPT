Finally, we know that Adam has 8000 more apples than Jackie, so A = J + 8000. We can use this last equation to substitute A in the other two equations: A + J = 12000 becomes J + 8000 + J = 12000, which simplifies to 2J + 8000 = 12000, and solving for J we get J = 2000. Then we can use this value to find A: A = J + 8000 = 10000. Finally, we can use both A and J to find H: H = A + J + 9000 = 10000 + 2000 + 9000 = 21000. So He has 21000 apples. The answer is 21000."
