We don't know y, but we can solve for x using the first equation and substitute it into the second equation:\n\nxy = 31444\nx = 31444/y\n\nx + (96578/y) = total number of bags\n\nSubstituting x:\n\n31444/y + (96578/y) = total number of bags\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n(31444 + 96578)/y = total number of bags\n\nSimplifying:\n\n128022/y = total number of bags\n\nNow we need to find y. We know that xy = 31444, so y = 31444/x. Substituting into the equation above:\n\n128022/(31444/x) = total number of bags\n\nSimplifying:\n\n128022x/31444 = total number of bags\n\nDividing:\n\n128022/31444 \u2248 4.07\n\nSo there are about 4.07 bags of cookies. Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we can round up to 5 bags. The answer is 5."

So we can set up an equation:\n\nr + (r + 3369) = 8984\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2r + 3369 = 8984\n\nSubtracting 3369 from both sides, we get:\n\n2r = 5615\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nr = 2807.5\n\nThis doesn't make sense, because we can't have half a page of homework.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation: (J + 4492) + J = 6738. Simplifying this equation, we get 2J + 4492 = 6738. Subtracting 4492 from both sides, we get 2J = 2246.

Since they can't plant a fraction of a flower bed, we know they planted 3 flower beds. If only 67380 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed, then they grew a total of 3 x 67380 = 202140 flowers.
