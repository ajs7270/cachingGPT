Putting it all together, we get: Ed + 9 = Doug - 27 + 24. Simplifying this equation, we get: Ed + 9 = Doug - 3. We can substitute Ed = Doug + 24 into this equation to get: Doug + 24 + 9 = Doug - 3. Simplifying further, we get: Doug = 18. This means that Ed had 18 + 24 = 42 marbles originally. After finding 9 more, he had 42 + 9 = 51 marbles. So Ed had 51 - 18 = 33 more marbles than Doug then.

Together, they have x + (x + 4) = 2x + 4 apples. We know that 2x + 4 + 6 = 14 (since Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together), so 2x = 4 and x = 2. This means Jackie has 2 apples, and Adam has 6 apples (since he has 4 more than Jackie). Together, they have 8 apples. Bob has 6 more than that, so he has 8 + 6 = 14 apples. The answer is 14."

We know that the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar, so there must be x + 8 cups of flour and x cups of sugar. Since Mary has already put in some cups of flour, we can set up an equation: x + 6 = x + 8 - 13. Solving for x, we get x = 11.

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get: (J + 4) + J = 6. Simplifying this equation, we get 2J + 4 = 6, which gives us J = 1. Therefore, Jackie has 1 apple.
