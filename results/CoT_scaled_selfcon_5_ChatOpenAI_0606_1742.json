Similarly, he found 8 wrappers at the park and now has 63, so he must have collected 63 - 8 = 55 wrappers since then. We don't know how many bottle caps he had at first, but we do know that the total number of bottle caps and wrappers he has now is 28 + 63 = 91. So, if we subtract the 55 wrappers he collected since finding the 8 at the park, we get 91 - 55 = 36, which is the number of bottle caps he had at first. The answer is 36."

We can use this to find Adam's number of apples:\n\nA = J + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10\n\nAdam has 10 apples.

Together, they have 14 apples, so we can set up the equation:\n\nJ + (J + 4) = 14\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n2J + 4 = 14\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get:\n\n2J = 10\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nJ = 5\n\nSo Jackie has 5 apples, and Adam has 4 more, or 9 apples. Together, they have 14 apples, so Bob has 6 more than that, or 20 apples. The answer is 20."

We know that A + J = 6, and that Adam has 4 more apples than A + J. So we can write:\n\nAdam = A + J + 4\n\nNow we can substitute 6 for A + J in the equation above:\n\nAdam = 6 + 4\nAdam = 10\n\nSo Adam has 10 apples. To find out how many apples Jackie has, we can substitute 6 for A + J in the equation A + J = 6:\n\n6 = J + A\n6 = J + 10\nJ = 6 - 10\nJ = -4\n\nUh-oh! It looks like we have a problem here. We can't have negative apples. This means there must be an error in the problem or in our calculations. It's possible that the problem is asking for the total number of apples that both Adam and Jackie have together, in which case the answer would be:\n\nAdam + Jackie = 10 + (-4) = 6\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the number of apples Adam has, we can't solve it with the information given."

We know that the grasshopper, frog, and mouse all participated in the jumping contest, so their jumps must add up to 39 + x + (x + 19) + (x - 12) = 3x + 46. We also know that this total distance is equal to the distance that the grasshopper jumped, which is 39 inches. So we can set up an equation: \n\n3x + 46 = 39 \n\nSubtracting 46 from both sides gives: \n\n3x = -7 \n\nDividing by 3 gives: \n\nx = -7/3 \n\nThis answer doesn't make sense, because it means the frog's jump distance is negative.

If 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding, then there are 82-19 = 63 snakes not hiding. To find the number of alligators not hiding, we can subtract the total number of animals not hiding (63 snakes + x alligators) from the original total of 78 animals: 78 - (63 + x) = 15 - x. This means there are 15 - x alligators not hiding. We don't know the exact value of x, but we can use the fact that the number of alligators not hiding must be a whole number. Therefore, the number of alligators not hiding could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10."
